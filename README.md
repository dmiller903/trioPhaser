# trioPhaser: Using Mendelian inheritance logic to improve genomic phasing of trios
Mendelian inheritance logic can be used to determine phase for the majority 
(67-83%) of variant nucleotide positions (Choi et al. 2018 & Roach et al. 2011). 
However, when both parents and the  child are heterozygotic (A/G), Mendelian 
inheritance alone cannot be used to determine phase. When such scenarios are 
present, phasing programs that rely on population-based haplotype reference 
panels can be used.

Available software that directly uses trios and Mendelian inheritance logic 
during phasing have limitations. For example, some software require multiple 
input sources (resulting in extensive storage requirements), or do not support 
current genome builds. To address these challenges, we have developed 
trioPhaser. 

trioPhaser can increase the total number of correctly phased positions by using
Mendelian inheritance logic in conjunction with *SHAPEIT4* [insert manuscript doi here].

## Installation (requires [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/))
```
docker pull dmill903/triophaser:latest
```
## Run trioPhaser on the included example data (see [here](https://github.com/dmiller903/trioPhaser/blob/main/validate/validate.pdf) for how we generated the files and for more details on how to run trioPhaser)
Here we provide example code on how to execute trioPhaser. In this example, 
the input files are provided within the container. Under normal circumstances, 
the input files will be on your local machine. This example implies the following:

1. There is a directory called `/Data` on the local machine.
2. We attached and called this directory `/proj` within the container.
3. We set `/proj` as our working directory within the container.
4. The `haplotype_references` directory has been created and is located at 
`/Data/haplotype_references` (*this is where trioPhaser will store the 
haplotype reference data).
5. The output file will be written to `/Data/phased_output.vcf.gz`
6. The container ID will be stored at `/Data/trio_phaser.out` upon execution. 

Update `/Data` and `haplotype_references` with the directories you want to use 
on your local machine. For example, if you want the output to be stored at 
`/tmp` and within `/tmp` you have a folder called `references`, you would 
change `/Data` to `/tmp` and `haplotype_references` to `references`.

Use `docker run -t dmill903/triophaser:latest python3 /trio_phaser.py -h`
learn more about trioPhaser's arguments and how multiple trios can be used
as input.

```ignore
docker run -d -v /Data:/proj -w /proj -t dmill903/triophaser:latest \
  python3 /trio_phaser.py \
  -c /trioPhaser/validate/son_ashkenazim_GRCh38_chr22.g.vcf.gz \
  -p /trioPhaser/validate/father_ashkenazim_GRCh38_chr22.g.vcf.gz \
  -m /trioPhaser/validate/mother_ashkenazim_GRCh38_chr22.g.vcf.gz \
  -o /proj/phased_output.vcf.gz \
  -r /proj/haplotype_references \
  > /Data/trio_phaser.out
```

*\*Note: The first time trioPhaser is run, it will download reference files, 
which may take a while depending on internet speed. Subsequent runs can use the
cached reference files.*
